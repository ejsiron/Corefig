# Corefig for Windows Server 2012 Core and Hyper-V Server 2012

Building on the foundation provided by the CoreConfig team on Core Configurator 2.0 ([http://coreconfig.codeplex.com](http://coreconfig.codeplex.com)), Corefig is a PowerShell-based GUI tool to configure the 2012 releases of Server Core and Hyper-V Server.

The application structure remains largely intact from the CoreConfig product but introduces several enhancements and leverages several of the new cmdlets.
